# Postgres SQL

## Types of Databases

-   **There are a few types of databases, all service different types of use-cases**

### NoSQL databases

1. Store data in a schema-less fashion. Extremely lean and fast way to store data.
2. Examples - MongoDB,

    ```json
    {
    	"_id": "1",
    	"name": "Jack",
    	"email": "jack@example.com"
    }
    ```

### Graph databases

1. Data is stored in the form of a graph. Specially useful in cases where relationships need to be stored (social networks)
2. Examples - Neo4j

    ```
    (:Person {id: "1", name: "Jack", email: "jack@example.com"})
    (:Company {name: "OpenAI"})
    (:Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(:Company)
    ```

### Vector databases

1. Stores data in the form of vectors
2. Useful in Machine learning
3. Examples - Pinecone

    ```json
    {
    	"id": "1",
    	"values": [0.12, 0.98, -0.33, 0.67],
    	"metadata": {
    		"name": "Jack",
    		"email": "jack@example.com"
    	}
    }
    ```

### SQL databases

1. Stores data in the form of rows
2. Most full stack applications will use this
3. Examples - MySQL, Postgres

    | id  | name | email                                       |
    | --- | ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
    | 1   | Jack | [jack@example.com](mailto:jack@example.com) |

## Why not NoSQL?

**Itâ€™s schemaless properties make it ideal to for bootstraping a project fast.**  
**But as your app grows, this property makes it very easy for data to get curropted**

### What is schemaless?

-   Different rows can have different schema (keys/types)

    ```json
    <!-- currect -->
    {
    	"_id": "1",
    	"name": "Jack",
    	"balance": 3500
    }
    <!-- wrong -->
    {
    	"_id": "1",
    	"name": "Jack",
    	"balance": "bob"
    }
    ```

### Problems?

1. Can lead to inconsistent database
2. Can cause runtime errors
3. Is too flexible for an app that needs strictness

### Upsides?

1. Can move very fast
2. Can change schema very easily

> You might think that `mongoose` does add strictness to the codebase because we used to define a schema there.
> That strictness is present at the Node.js level, not at the DB level. You can still put in erroneous data in the database that doesnâ€™t follow that schema.

## Why SQL?

### SQL databases have a strict schema. They require you to

1. Define your schema
2. Put in data that follows that schema
3. Update the schema as your app changes and perform `migrations`

### So there are 4 parts when using an SQL database (not connecting it to Node.js, just running it and putting data in it)

1. Running the database.
2. Using a library that letâ€™s you connect and put data in it.
3. Creating a table and defining itâ€™s `schema`.
4. Run queries on the database to interact with the data (`Insert`/`Update`/`Delete`)

## Creating a database (SQL)

**You can start a Potgres database in a few ways -**

### Using `neondb`

https://neon.tech/ is a decent service that letâ€™s you create a server.

-   Connection string
    ```
    postgresql://username:password@ep-broken-frost-69135494.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/calm-gobbler-41_db_2253874
    ```

### Using docker locally

-   Command

    ```
    docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
    ```

-   Connection String
    ```
    postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
    ```

## Using a library that letâ€™s you connect and put data in it.

### 1. psql

`psql` is a `terminal-based` front-end to PostgreSQL. It provides an interactive command-line interface to the PostgreSQL (or TimescaleDB) database. With psql, you can type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results.

**How to connect to your database?**

-   psql Comes bundled with postgresql. You donâ€™t need it for this tutorial. We will directly be communicating with the database from `Node.js`

    ```
    psql -h p-broken-frost-69135494.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech -d database1 -U 100xdevs
    ```

### 2. pg

`pg` is a `Node.js` library that you can use in your backend app to store data in the Postgres DB (similar to mongoose). We will be installing this eventually in our app.

## Creating a table and defining itâ€™s schema.

### Tables in SQL

-   A single database can have multiple `tables` inside. Think of them as `collections` in a MongoDB database.
-   Until now, we have a database that we can interact with. The next step in case of postgres is to define the `schema` of your tables.
-   SQL stands for `Structured query language`. It is a language in which you can describe what/how you want to put data in the database.

    **To create a table, the command to run is -**

    ```
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

**There are a few parts of this SQL statement, letâ€™s decode them one by one**

> 1. CREATE TABLE users

-   `CREATE TABLE users`: This command initiates the creation of a new table in the database named users.

> 2. id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY

-   `id`: The name of the first column in the users table, typically used as a unique identifier for each row (user). Similar to \_id in mongodb
-   `SERIAL`: A PostgreSQL-specific data type for creating an auto-incrementing integer. Every time a new row is inserted, this value automatically increments, ensuring each user has a unique id.
-   `PRIMARY KEY`: This constraint specifies that the id column is the primary key for the table, meaning it uniquely identifies each row. Values in this column must be unique and not null.

> 3.  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL

-   `email`: The name of the second column, intended to store the user's username.
-   `VARCHAR(50)`: A variable character string data type that can store up to 50 characters. It's used here to limit the length of the username.
-   `UNIQUE`: This constraint ensures that all values in the username column are unique across the table. No two users can have the same username.
-   `NOT NULL`: This constraint prevents null values from being inserted into the username column. Every row must have a username value.

> 4. password VARCHAR(255) NOT NUL

-   Same as above, can be non uniqye

> 5. created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

-   `created_at`: The name of the fifth column, intended to store the timestamp when the user was created.
-   `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`: This data type stores both a timestamp and a time zone, allowing for the precise tracking of when an event occurred, regardless of the user's or server's time zone.
-   `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`: This default value automatically sets the created_at column to the date and time at which the row is inserted into the table, using the current timestamp of the database server.

**Then try running**

-   ```
      \dt;
    ```

-   to see if the table has been created or not

## Interacting with the database

**There are 4 things youâ€™d like to do with a database**

### 1. INSERT

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
VALUES ('username_here', 'user@example.com', 'user_password');
```

> ðŸ’¡Notice how you didnâ€™t have to specify the id because it auto increments

### 2. UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE users
SET password = 'new_password'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### 3. DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```

### 4. Select

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```

> ðŸ’¡Try running all 4 of these in your terminal if you have `psql` installed locally.  
> ðŸ’¡ If not, thatâ€™s fine weâ€™ll eventually be doing these through the `pg` library.

## How to do queries from a Node.js app?

-   In the end, postgres exposes a protocol that someone needs to talk to be able to send these commands (update, delete) to the database.
-   `psql` is one such library that takes commands from your terminal and sends it over to the database.
-   To do the same in a Node.js , you can use one of many `Postgres clients`

### pg library

-   [**pg package**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js. [**Documentation**](https://node-postgres.com/)

-   Connecting-

    ```js
    import { Client } from "pg";

    const client = new Client({
    	host: "my.database-server.com",
    	port: 5334,
    	database: "database-name",
    	user: "database-user",
    	password: "secretpassword!!",
    });

    client.connect();
    ```

-   Querying-

    ```js
    const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM USERS;");
    console.log(result);
    ```

-   Write a function to create a users table in your database.

    ```js
    import { Client } from "pg";

    const client = new Client({
    	connectionString:
    		"postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost/postgres",
    });

    async function createUsersTable() {
    	await client.connect();
    	const result = await client.query(`
            CREATE TABLE users (
                id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
                created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            );
        `);
    	console.log(result);
    }

    createUsersTable();
    ```

## Creating a simple Node.js app

### Initialise an empty typescript project

```bash
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
```

### Change the `rootDir` and `outDir` in `tsconfig.json`

```
"rootDir": "./src",
"outDir": "./dist",
```

### Install the `pg` library and itâ€™s types (because weâ€™re using TS)

```bash
npm install pg
npm install @types/pg
```

### Create a simple Node.js app that lets you put data

**Create a function that letâ€™s you insert data into a table. Make it async, make sure client.connect resolves before u do the insert**

```js
import { Client } from "pg";

// Async function to insert data into a table
async function insertData() {
	const client = new Client({
		host: "localhost",
		port: 5432,
		database: "postgres",
		user: "postgres",
		password: "mysecretpassword",
	});

	try {
		await client.connect(); // Ensure client connection is established
		const insertQuery =
			"INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('username2', 'user3@example.com', 'user_password');";
		const res = await client.query(insertQuery);
		console.log("Insertion success:", res); // Output insertion result
	} catch (err) {
		console.error("Error during the insertion:", err);
	} finally {
		await client.end(); // Close the client connection
	}
}

insertData();
```

> ðŸ’¡This is an `insecure` way to store data in your tables.
> When you expose this functionality eventually via HTTP, someone can do an `SQL INJECTION` to get access to your data/delete your data.

**More secure way to store data.**

-   Update the code so you donâ€™t put user provided fields in the `SQL string`

-   What are user provided strings?
    In your final app, this insert statement will be done when a user signs up on your app.
    Email, username, password are all user provided strings

-   What is the SQL string ?

    ```ts
    const insertQuery =
    	"INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('username2', 'user3@example.com', 'user_password');";
    ```

-   Hint

    ```ts
    const insertQuery =
    	"INSERT INTO example_table(column1, column2) VALUES($1, $2)";
    const res = await client.query(insertQuery, [column1Value, column2Value]);
    ```

-   Solution

    ```ts
    import { Client } from "pg";

    // Async function to insert data into a table
    async function insertData(
    	username: string,
    	email: string,
    	password: string
    ) {
    	const client = new Client({
    		host: "localhost",
    		port: 5432,
    		database: "postgres",
    		user: "postgres",
    		password: "mysecretpassword",
    	});

    	try {
    		await client.connect(); // Ensure client connection is established
    		// Use parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
    		const insertQuery =
    			"INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)";
    		const values = [username, email, password];
    		const res = await client.query(insertQuery, values);
    		console.log("Insertion success:", res); // Output insertion result
    	} catch (err) {
    		console.error("Error during the insertion:", err);
    	} finally {
    		await client.end(); // Close the client connection
    	}
    }

    // Example usage
    insertData("username5", "user5@example.com", "user_password").catch(
    	console.error
    );
    ```

### Query data

**Write a function getUser that lets you fetch data from the database given a email as input.**

```ts
import { Client } from "pg";

// Async function to fetch user data from the database given an email
async function getUser(email: string) {
	const client = new Client({
		host: "localhost",
		port: 5432,
		database: "postgres",
		user: "postgres",
		password: "mysecretpassword",
	});

	try {
		await client.connect(); // Ensure client connection is established
		const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1";
		const values = [email];
		const result = await client.query(query, values);

		if (result.rows.length > 0) {
			console.log("User found:", result.rows[0]); // Output user data
			return result.rows[0]; // Return the user data
		} else {
			console.log("No user found with the given email.");
			return null; // Return null if no user was found
		}
	} catch (err) {
		console.error("Error during fetching user:", err);
		throw err; // Rethrow or handle error appropriately
	} finally {
		await client.end(); // Close the client connection
	}
}

// Example usage
getUser("user5@example.com").catch(console.error);
```

## Relationships and Transactions

**Relationships let you store data in different tables and `relate` it with each other.**

### Relationships in Mongodb

-   Since `mongodb` is a NoSQL database, you can store any shape of data in it.
-   If I ask you to store a users details along with their address, you can store it in an object that has the address details.

### Relationships in SQL

-   Since SQL can not store objects as such, we need to define two different tables to store this data in.
-   If I ask you to store a users details along with their address, you can store it in an object that has the address details.

### Relationships in SQL

-   Since SQL can not store `objects` as such, we need to define two different tables to store this data in.
-   This is called a `relationship` , which means that the `Address` table is related to the `Users` table.
-   When defining the table, you need to define the `relationship`

    ```ts
    	CREATE TABLE users (
    	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    	username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    	email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    	password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    	created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

    CREATE TABLE addresses (
    	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    	user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    	city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    	country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    	street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    	pincode VARCHAR(20),
    	created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    );
    ```

### SQL query

-   To insert the address of a user -

    ```ts
    INSERT INTO addresses (user_id, city, country, street, pincode)
    VALUES (1, 'New York', 'USA', '123 Broadway St', '10001');
    ```

-   Now if you want to get the address of a user given an id , you can run the following query -

    ```ts
    SELECT city, country, street, pincode
    FROM addresses
    WHERE user_id = 1;
    ```
