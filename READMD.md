# Postgres SQL

## Types of Databases

-   **There are a few types of databases, all service different types of use-cases**

### NoSQL databases

1. Store data in a schema-less fashion. Extremely lean and fast way to store data.
2. Examples - MongoDB,

    ```json
    {
    	"_id": "1",
    	"name": "Jack",
    	"email": "jack@example.com"
    }
    ```

### Graph databases

1. Data is stored in the form of a graph. Specially useful in cases where relationships need to be stored (social networks)
2. Examples - Neo4j

    ```
    (:Person {id: "1", name: "Jack", email: "jack@example.com"})
    (:Company {name: "OpenAI"})
    (:Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(:Company)
    ```

### Vector databases

1. Stores data in the form of vectors
2. Useful in Machine learning
3. Examples - Pinecone

    ```json
    {
    	"id": "1",
    	"values": [0.12, 0.98, -0.33, 0.67],
    	"metadata": {
    		"name": "Jack",
    		"email": "jack@example.com"
    	}
    }
    ```

### SQL databases

1. Stores data in the form of rows
2. Most full stack applications will use this
3. Examples - MySQL, Postgres

    | id  | name | email                                       |
    | --- | ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
    | 1   | Jack | [jack@example.com](mailto:jack@example.com) |

## Why not NoSQL?

**Itâ€™s schemaless properties make it ideal to for bootstraping a project fast.**  
**But as your app grows, this property makes it very easy for data to get curropted**

### What is schemaless?

-   Different rows can have different schema (keys/types)

    ```json
    <!-- currect -->
    {
    	"_id": "1",
    	"name": "Jack",
    	"balance": 3500
    }
    <!-- wrong -->
    {
    	"_id": "1",
    	"name": "Jack",
    	"balance": "bob"
    }
    ```

### Problems?

1. Can lead to inconsistent database
2. Can cause runtime errors
3. Is too flexible for an app that needs strictness

### Upsides?

1. Can move very fast
2. Can change schema very easily

> You might think that `mongoose` does add strictness to the codebase because we used to define a schema there.
> That strictness is present at the Node.js level, not at the DB level. You can still put in erroneous data in the database that doesnâ€™t follow that schema.

## Why SQL?

### SQL databases have a strict schema. They require you to

1. Define your schema
2. Put in data that follows that schema
3. Update the schema as your app changes and perform `migrations`

### So there are 4 parts when using an SQL database (not connecting it to Node.js, just running it and putting data in it)

1. Running the database.
2. Using a library that letâ€™s you connect and put data in it.
3. Creating a table and defining itâ€™s `schema`.
4. Run queries on the database to interact with the data (`Insert`/`Update`/`Delete`)

## Creating a database (SQL)

**You can start a Potgres database in a few ways -**

### Using `neondb`

https://neon.tech/ is a decent service that letâ€™s you create a server.

-   Connection string
    ```
    postgresql://username:password@ep-broken-frost-69135494.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/calm-gobbler-41_db_2253874
    ```

### Using docker locally

-   Command

    ```
    docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
    ```

-   Connection String
    ```
    postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
    ```

### Using docker on windows

How to run postgrSQL in windows terminal(if you have docker installed).

-   fist run docker gui application that help in running commands in terminal.
-   After that run it with the docker instance by the help of following command .
    -   for the first time if the image is not downloaded .
    -   docker run --name my-postgres1 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres.
    -   if the docker image is there, prior to use the it can simply be runned by docker run <image name>.
-   After that ,
    -   use docker exec -it my-postgres1 psql -U postgres -d postgres this command in terminal .
    -   then enter the password and it will connect to localhost Postgress instance .
    -   now you will be inside the postress command line that looks like postgres-# .
-   U can check it by running \\dt , (the command to display all the tables.)

## Using a library that letâ€™s you connect and put data in it.

### 1. psql

`psql` is a `terminal-based` front-end to PostgreSQL. It provides an interactive command-line interface to the PostgreSQL (or TimescaleDB) database. With psql, you can type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results.

**How to connect to your database?**

-   psql Comes bundled with postgresql. You donâ€™t need it for this tutorial. We will directly be communicating with the database from `Node.js`

    ```
    psql -h p-broken-frost-69135494.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech -d database1 -U 100xdevs
    ```

### 2. pg

`pg` is a `Node.js` library that you can use in your backend app to store data in the Postgres DB (similar to mongoose). We will be installing this eventually in our app.

## Creating a table and defining itâ€™s schema.

### Tables in SQL

-   A single database can have multiple `tables` inside. Think of them as `collections` in a MongoDB database.
-   Until now, we have a database that we can interact with. The next step in case of postgres is to define the `schema` of your tables.
-   SQL stands for `Structured query language`. It is a language in which you can describe what/how you want to put data in the database.

    **To create a table, the command to run is -**

    ```
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

**There are a few parts of this SQL statement, letâ€™s decode them one by one**

> 1. CREATE TABLE users

-   `CREATE TABLE users`: This command initiates the creation of a new table in the database named users.

> 2. id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY

-   `id`: The name of the first column in the users table, typically used as a unique identifier for each row (user). Similar to \_id in mongodb
-   `SERIAL`: A PostgreSQL-specific data type for creating an auto-incrementing integer. Every time a new row is inserted, this value automatically increments, ensuring each user has a unique id.
-   `PRIMARY KEY`: This constraint specifies that the id column is the primary key for the table, meaning it uniquely identifies each row. Values in this column must be unique and not null.

> 3.  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL

-   `email`: The name of the second column, intended to store the user's username.
-   `VARCHAR(50)`: A variable character string data type that can store up to 50 characters. It's used here to limit the length of the username.
-   `UNIQUE`: This constraint ensures that all values in the username column are unique across the table. No two users can have the same username.
-   `NOT NULL`: This constraint prevents null values from being inserted into the username column. Every row must have a username value.

> 4. password VARCHAR(255) NOT NUL

-   Same as above, can be non uniqye

> 5. created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

-   `created_at`: The name of the fifth column, intended to store the timestamp when the user was created.
-   `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`: This data type stores both a timestamp and a time zone, allowing for the precise tracking of when an event occurred, regardless of the user's or server's time zone.
-   `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`: This default value automatically sets the created_at column to the date and time at which the row is inserted into the table, using the current timestamp of the database server.

**Then try running**

-   ```
      \dt;
    ```

-   to see if the table has been created or not

## Interacting with the database

**There are 4 things youâ€™d like to do with a database**

### 1. INSERT

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
VALUES ('username_here', 'user@example.com', 'user_password');
```

> ðŸ’¡Notice how you didnâ€™t have to specify the id because it auto increments

### 2. UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE users
SET password = 'new_password'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### 3. DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```

### 4. Select

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```

> ðŸ’¡Try running all 4 of these in your terminal if you have `psql` installed locally.  
> ðŸ’¡ If not, thatâ€™s fine weâ€™ll eventually be doing these through the `pg` library.

## How to do queries from a Node.js app?

-   In the end, postgres exposes a protocol that someone needs to talk to be able to send these commands (update, delete) to the database.
-   `psql` is one such library that takes commands from your terminal and sends it over to the database.
-   To do the same in a Node.js , you can use one of many `Postgres clients`

### pg library

-   [**pg package**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js. [**Documentation**](https://node-postgres.com/)

-   Connecting-

    ```js
    import { Client } from "pg";

    const client = new Client({
    	host: "my.database-server.com",
    	port: 5334,
    	database: "database-name",
    	user: "database-user",
    	password: "secretpassword!!",
    });

    client.connect();
    ```

-   Querying-

    ```js
    const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM USERS;");
    console.log(result);
    ```

-   Write a function to create a users table in your database.

    ```js
    import { Client } from "pg";

    const client = new Client({
    	connectionString:
    		"postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost/postgres",
    });

    async function createUsersTable() {
    	await client.connect();
    	const result = await client.query(`
            CREATE TABLE users (
                id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
                created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            );
        `);
    	console.log(result);
    }

    createUsersTable();
    ```

## Creating a simple Node.js app

### Initialise an empty typescript project

```bash
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
```

### Change the `rootDir` and `outDir` in `tsconfig.json`

```
"rootDir": "./src",
"outDir": "./dist",
```

### Install the `pg` library and itâ€™s types (because weâ€™re using TS)

```bash
npm install pg
npm install @types/pg
```

### Create a simple Node.js app that lets you put data

**Create a function that letâ€™s you insert data into a table. Make it async, make sure client.connect resolves before u do the insert**

```js
import { Client } from "pg";

// Async function to insert data into a table
async function insertData() {
	const client = new Client({
		host: "localhost",
		port: 5432,
		database: "postgres",
		user: "postgres",
		password: "mysecretpassword",
	});

	try {
		await client.connect(); // Ensure client connection is established
		const insertQuery =
			"INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('username2', 'user3@example.com', 'user_password');";
		const res = await client.query(insertQuery);
		console.log("Insertion success:", res); // Output insertion result
	} catch (err) {
		console.error("Error during the insertion:", err);
	} finally {
		await client.end(); // Close the client connection
	}
}

insertData();
```

> ðŸ’¡This is an `insecure` way to store data in your tables.
> When you expose this functionality eventually via HTTP, someone can do an `SQL INJECTION` to get access to your data/delete your data.

**More secure way to store data.**

-   Update the code so you donâ€™t put user provided fields in the `SQL string`

-   What are user provided strings?
    In your final app, this insert statement will be done when a user signs up on your app.
    Email, username, password are all user provided strings

-   What is the SQL string ?

    ```ts
    const insertQuery =
    	"INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('username2', 'user3@example.com', 'user_password');";
    ```

-   Hint

    ```ts
    const insertQuery =
    	"INSERT INTO example_table(column1, column2) VALUES($1, $2)";
    const res = await client.query(insertQuery, [column1Value, column2Value]);
    ```

-   Solution

    ```ts
    import { Client } from "pg";

    // Async function to insert data into a table
    async function insertData(
    	username: string,
    	email: string,
    	password: string
    ) {
    	const client = new Client({
    		host: "localhost",
    		port: 5432,
    		database: "postgres",
    		user: "postgres",
    		password: "mysecretpassword",
    	});

    	try {
    		await client.connect(); // Ensure client connection is established
    		// Use parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
    		const insertQuery =
    			"INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)";
    		const values = [username, email, password];
    		const res = await client.query(insertQuery, values);
    		console.log("Insertion success:", res); // Output insertion result
    	} catch (err) {
    		console.error("Error during the insertion:", err);
    	} finally {
    		await client.end(); // Close the client connection
    	}
    }

    // Example usage
    insertData("username5", "user5@example.com", "user_password").catch(
    	console.error
    );
    ```

### Query data

**Write a function getUser that lets you fetch data from the database given a email as input.**

```ts
import { Client } from "pg";

// Async function to fetch user data from the database given an email
async function getUser(email: string) {
	const client = new Client({
		host: "localhost",
		port: 5432,
		database: "postgres",
		user: "postgres",
		password: "mysecretpassword",
	});

	try {
		await client.connect(); // Ensure client connection is established
		const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1";
		const values = [email];
		const result = await client.query(query, values);

		if (result.rows.length > 0) {
			console.log("User found:", result.rows[0]); // Output user data
			return result.rows[0]; // Return the user data
		} else {
			console.log("No user found with the given email.");
			return null; // Return null if no user was found
		}
	} catch (err) {
		console.error("Error during fetching user:", err);
		throw err; // Rethrow or handle error appropriately
	} finally {
		await client.end(); // Close the client connection
	}
}

// Example usage
getUser("user5@example.com").catch(console.error);
```

## Relationships and Transactions

**Relationships let you store data in different tables and `relate` it with each other.**

### Relationships in Mongodb

-   Since `mongodb` is a NoSQL database, you can store any shape of data in it.
-   If I ask you to store a users details along with their address, you can store it in an object that has the address details.

### Relationships in SQL

-   Since SQL can not store objects as such, we need to define two different tables to store this data in.
-   If I ask you to store a users details along with their address, you can store it in an object that has the address details.

### Relationships in SQL

-   Since SQL can not store `objects` as such, we need to define two different tables to store this data in.
-   This is called a `relationship` , which means that the `Address` table is related to the `Users` table.
-   When defining the table, you need to define the `relationship`

    ```ts
    	CREATE TABLE users (
    	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    	username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    	email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    	password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    	created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

    CREATE TABLE addresses (
    	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    	user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    	city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    	country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    	street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    	pincode VARCHAR(20),
    	created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    );
    ```

### SQL query

-   To insert the address of a user -

    ```ts
    INSERT INTO addresses (user_id, city, country, street, pincode)
    VALUES (1, 'New York', 'USA', '123 Broadway St', '10001');
    ```

-   Now if you want to get the address of a user given an id , you can run the following query -

    ```ts
    SELECT city, country, street, pincode
    FROM addresses
    WHERE user_id = 1;
    ```

## Joins

**Defining relationships is easy.**

-   Whatâ€™s hard is `joining` data from two (or more) tables together.
-   For example, if I ask you to fetch me a `users` details and their `address`, what SQL would you run?
-   Approach 1 (Bad)

    ```ts
    // Query 1: Fetch user's details
    SELECT id, username, email
    FROM users
    WHERE id = YOUR_USER_ID;

    // Query 2: Fetch user's address
    SELECT city, country, street, pincode
    FROM addresses
    WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID;
    ```

-   Approach 2 (Using joins)

    ```ts
    SELECT users.id, users.username, users.email, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
    FROM users
    JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id
    WHERE users.id = YOUR_USER_ID;
    ```

    ```ts
    SELECT u.id, u.username, u.email, a.city, a.country, a.street, a.pincode
    FROM users u
    JOIN addresses a ON u.id = a.user_id
    WHERE u.id = YOUR_USER_ID;
    ```

### Benefits of using a join -

1. Reduced Latency
2. Simplified Application Logic
3. Transactional Integrity

### Types of Joins

1. **INNER JOIN**

    - Returns rows when there is at least one match in both tables. If there is no match, the rows are not returned. It's the most common type of join.
    - **Use Case**: Find All Users With Their Addresses. If a user hasnâ€™t filled their address, that user shouldnâ€™t be returned

        ```ts
        SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
        FROM users
        INNER JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
        ```

2. **LEFT JOIN**

    - Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table.
    - **Use case** - To list all users from your database along with their address information (if they've provided it), you'd use a LEFT JOIN. Users without an address will still appear in your query result, but the address fields will be NULL for them.

        ```ts
        SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
        FROM users
        LEFT JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
        ```

3. **RIGHT JOIN**

    - Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table.
    - **Use case** - Given the structure of the database, a RIGHT JOIN would be less common since the addresses table is unlikely to have entries not linked to a user due to the foreign key constraint. However, if you had a situation where you start with the addresses table and optionally include user information, this would be the theoretical **use case**.

        ```ts
        SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
        FROM users
        RIGHT JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
        ```

4. **FULL JOIN**

    - Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. It effectively combines the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.
    - **Use case** - A FULL JOIN would combine all records from both users and addresses, showing the relationship where it exists. Given the constraints, this might not be as relevant because every address should be linked to a user, but if there were somehow orphaned records on either side, this query would reveal them.

        ```ts
          SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
          FROM users
          FULL JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
        ```
